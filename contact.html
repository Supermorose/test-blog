        <h3>Contact Me.</h3>
        <p>This isn't really a typical Contage page. I have no interest at this moment in anybody knowing who I am, but if by some happenstance you wind up reading this website and feel so inclined to reach out for whatever reason, you can send an email to funeralgradeflowers@gmail.com. The date is December 9th, 2022. I'll try to figure out how to add a simple form here for you to submit your own information if you do need to contact me but until then this will suffice.</p>
