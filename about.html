        <h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Why?</h3>
        <p>This website is intended to be a simple outlet for me. I like to write. By no means would I consider myself some prodigy of the English language, but I know my way around it. The reason I want to write here is because I often get the feeling that it would be cathartic, even if only slightly, to just get my thoughts out of my head and onto something more tangible. In essence, this website would serve as a journal or something amounting to a blog, albeit a lot less flashy than other blogs I've seen. I think in my mind I know that if I want to go for any kind of visual aesthetic on a website like this, it would be minimalist. I also know that a minimalist aesthetic doesn't necessarily mean that I won't have to code. I think going for a minimalist and lowkey look requires its own amount of work.</p>
        <p>My HTML and CSS knowledge is still in it's genesis, so while I don't expect that I'll embellish the visuals of this website in a way that would catch someone's eye, I do have my own vision for what purpose this journal is meant to serve and what it's meant to look like. In the very unfortunate circumstance that I fail or give up on my enjoyment of coding, at the very least I think this will be a nice and unwinding form of practicing both my HTML and CSS that I can come back and look at regardless of what lies ahead of me at the present. That's the beauty of a project like this for someone with the kind of idiosyncrasies that I have. I like to preserve things for future reference, and this in itself is an endeavor in that regard. Regardless of the passing of time and what happens to me, this writing will always be here, even if it doesn't make it onto the public internet or onto anyone else's machine. I will know that I wrote it, and did my own diligence in attempting to preserve the fleeting nature of my own thoughts and emotions so that they would stand the test of time.</p>
