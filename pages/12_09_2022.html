        <h3>The Weekend</h3>
        <p>It's Friday in the afternoon. I haven't done anything today besides pick up my dad's truck from the tire shop. They took the modified tires off the old truck that I totaled, and placed them on the new truck. I know my dad probably still feels some kind of lingering dismay over the entire ordeal with his truck, but at the very least he's been modifying his new truck to his liking and buying all sorts of aesthetic parts for it. I got home after that and just served myself a bowl of cereal; I'm feeling a little too sluggish to get off my ass and drive somewhere for food at the moment. It's likely I'll do some coursework off The Odin Project after I'm done with this entry, and after that maybe I'll watch something on Hulu or play a videogame. Today has been uneventful for the most part, but I've got some things to look forward to later today and this following weekend.</p>
        <p>For starters, my younger brother's school is putting on a program of sorts in celebration of the holidays. My mom got tickets for my girlfriend and I to go, and I know the little guy will appreciate us going so we're making the effort. Tomorrow my girlfriend and I are returning to the ultrasound technician's place and they're going to do a scan to reveal the gender of our child! Obviously she and I won't know since we are planning to do a gender reveal part with our family, but we're taking her older sister with us so that she can receive the information and plan accordingly. I'll probably stay in the car with her sister's kid so that there's no chance I can extrapolate the gender from even being in the ultrasound room looking at the live feed of the baby. I'm excited that we're taking my girlfriend to get that scan done but I'm also nervous about finding out the gender and whether we will be able to plan a gender reveal party that my girlfriend will be happy with.</p>
        <p>I'm still waiting on Enterprise Rent-a-Car to contact me and let me know if I got hired. I applied about two to three weeks ago and I've done three different interviews, and I want to say that I did well enough, but I'm the kind of person that really overthinks things so I've been racking my brain the last few days wondering if I said something unbecoming or gave a response that was less than impressive to the interviewer. I would love to get this job and start on my path to building a career, but I'm not exactly holding my breath for the time being. I'm still going to continue filling out other applications and setting up other phone interviews.</p>
        <p>All in all, I'm feeling okay today. I like the weekends because I tend to focus a lot less on the negative things that my brain so adamantly clings to. It's easy to kind of detach myself from the worries of my weekdays when I'm not home and don't have access to my job applications or anything of the sort. I hope things pan out for me in a good way soon, because I'm really trying my best to make something happen. See ya!</p>

        <p>P.S. That new SZA album 'SOS' dropped yesterday night. I listened to most of it, and my verdict is that it's not nearly as good as CTRl was. There are some decent songs I will admit, but It appears that the general consensus is that the album is good. Maybe I'm in the wrong then.</p>
