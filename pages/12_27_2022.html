        <h3>Dejection</h3>
        <p>The Christmas weekend has just passed. I spend Christmas Eve at my girlfriend's house with her family, and Christmas Day was spent at my family's house where we shared a nice dinner with my parents and exchanged some small gifts. I also got some gifts for my best friend and his girlfriend but we haven't had the opportunity to get together in person and figure that out. Honestly, I enjoyed Christmas despite everything going on in my life. It's a little challenging maintaining a positive attitude some days, especially during the holidays when sad feelings can feel amplified by the increased need to keep up appearances for the sake of others and compartmentalizing negative feelings.</p> 
        <p>I haven't had any correspondence about the car accident that I touched upon in some of my other entries, so I hope that's an issue that has resolved itself through my insurance but I am not going to bank on that being a certainty. Unfortunately Enterprise chose not to offer me a position even after three rounds of interviews. I wish I could say definitively what it is that could have caused me to be rejected after what seemed like a promising chain of interviews; The worst part of the ambiguity of a statement like that is that I can't be sure it's not something I can attribute to my impatience. I contacted their office location two weeks after my last interview to ask for a simple update, which I was told I would receive sometime that week. After that week had passed and I still hadn't received anything, I called a week after my first call and left a message for one of my interviewers simply asking if there was any available update on my application status. I am unsure if that was unprofessional of me or somehow affected my standing as far as receiving a job offer but I am feeling severely dejected after getting their rejection email this morning. Being denied never feels good, but I am in a position where I can not afford to continue being rejected from positions and I am actively busting my ass to ensure that I can make something work out for me. It's just a very defeating feeling.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the spectrum, I spent about three hours last night completing a document that I was tasked to fill out by the owner of a State Farm agency I had an interview at, two days before Christmas. I think that although I have a real lack of experience in sales and insurance, he still sees the potential I can harvest and my willingness to dedicate myself to a task. After the interview he asked me to simply fill out an "Agency Business Plan". It's a document that sort of delineates the mission of the agency and the target demographics and how those can be served by that specific agency. I had to list out my personal and business goals and really hone in on how I would go about marketing to certain demographics that make up our local populace. I figured I would have it finished a lot sooner than I did, given that I had a timeframe of about five days to complete it, including Christmas Day and the entire weekend which I usually spend at my girlfriends where I don't have access to a computer. I must've gone to sleep at about 4 in the morning after grinding out the rest of the document to make sure that I submitted it in a timely manner and that the answers reflected well on my character. Again, I am not banking on this opportunity panning out and quite frankly, I don't find the prospect of working as an insurance broker or an agent at State Farm to be all that enticing but anything that is a step above minimum wage and can help me to provide for my family will have to do.</p>
        <p>I still haven't spoken to the assistant principal from my old high school about job opportunities, mostly because I am afraid I will seem punishing if I contact her again asking if she has any free time to talk when she has already confirmed she will get back to me when she has the time. There's a thin line between feeling like I am being a punisher about things, and feeling like I have no choice but to be that person because it is in the best interest of my family for me to do things I don't want to do as a means of getting something done.</p>
        <p>It sounds superficial and defeatist but given the circumstances it feels like my life is no longer about what I want for myself. That genuinely terrifies me more than anything ever has.</p>
