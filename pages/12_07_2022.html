        <h3>Uncertainty</h3>
        <p>My first entry. This one turned out to be sort of longform, but I'm still not sure that everything I write will be this length. Sometimes I have a lot on my mind, and sometimes I don't.</p>
        <p>Today is December 7th of 2022. I've got a few things to do today but what I've been lacking lately is the motivation to leave my room. I don't think I'm depressed or anything, I've just been in a bit of a slump these last few months. I'll make a concerted effort to not reveal so much personal information about myself that someone could find me easily, but I'll still attempt to relay some of the things that have been lingering in my mind.</p>
        <p>My girlfriend is about 15 weeks pregnant at this point! I am happy for us and I want to do everything in my capacity to be the best father I can be when the time comes. As selfish as it sounds though, part of me still believes that I wasn't ready for a child. I mean that financially for the most part. I have no doubt that I will love my kid so much that it will annoy them and everyone else around me, but love doesn't pay bills. There's a lot of uncertainty for me as far as my ability to provide for my girlfriend and child. I've been applying to different jobs, because although I have a little bit of money saved, it's not going to be sustainable to be unemployed for much longer; hence me wanting to teach myself full-stack development. I know that it would be incredibly easy to apply to some run-of-the-mill fast food place paying minimum wage, but I know that I'm worth more than that. I don't mean that in the sense that simply because I finished college that I'm above the act of working for minimum wage. What I mean to say is that I know my ambitions and what I'm capable of, and I would be remiss to not make a genuine attempt at something beyond minimum wage. Of course if push comes to shove, I will do whatever it takes but in my mind I still have some time before the 'shove' arrives. Still, I am nothing short of excited to be starting my own family with my girlfriend.</p>
        <p>That aside, the last two months have been stressful. My parents have been bickering a lot more, and it seems that they are unhappy with the amount of arguing that they do over insignificant problems. I also got into a car crash in October, where I totaled my stepdad's truck, and I still have to worry that insurance policy limit won't be enough to satisfy the other driver. The other driver got a lawyer, and is attempting to get medical payment. Our insurance has told us not to worry and to let them handle it, but it's still something that looms over my head because the correspondence between our insurance and his lawyer seems stagnated. It always makes me feel weird seeing a piece of mail from our insurance company knowing that It's probably some other legalese related to the accident and then having to dive back in to a realm of calling our insurance on the phone and having things explained to us. It's not fun.</p>
        <p>I'm really trying my best though. All things considered, the only way to move forward is with applomb. I could mope around and feel sorry for myself (and on occasion I do indulge in the practice), but that does nothing for me or for my problems or for anyone else in my life. I'm still marching forward and submitting my job applications, and putting in my hours to The Odin Project to learn full-stack development. I'm still attempting to make time for my friends and my interests because it's easy to forget that there are things outside of 'adulting' that I can still engage in. Although it feels like life has been beating me down, I know that I can't just give up because it's no longer a choice. I'm going to work myself to the bone if that is what is required of me in this lifetime. I'm not going to be a deadbeat like my biological father, and I'm not going to be a dissapointment to the people in my life who have made it a good one so far.</p>
        <p>I'm tying the cord here for the time being. I think I want to at least add some kind of section on these entries to maybe highlight some time-specific descriptions; Maybe if I'm watching a certain movie or show, or if I'm reading a certain book, or listening to a certain song or album. Just fleeting moments that I can attach to an entry to give it more character. I don't have a format for that in mind but I'll come up with something. Until then.</p>
