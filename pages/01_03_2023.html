        <h3>The New Year</h3>
        <p>First entry to ring in the new year. Hopefully we can make this year a lot more productive than the last.</p>
        <p>Realistically, nothing has changed in the last few days and it makes sense that nothing should. The changing of the year is more of a symbolic proposition if we really think about the concept of time anyways. I won't get into the semantics or a philosophical discussion about time as a concept. The year has changed, and although for the most part, my life remains in the same position as before, there are still things to look upon happily and things I will instill symbolic value to in my own life.</p>
        <p>I'm not technically employed yet, but it seems that any day now, the manager of the State Farm I applied to will be propositioning me with a formal job offer to work at his agency. With all due respect, the prospect of being an insurance broker does not seem all that exciting and promising for someone with my tastes (read: weird), but the irrevocable truth is that a job is a job. This is better than a minimum wage retail or fast food job, and probably will present at least markedly more opportunities for growth as far as a career in insurance can go. Though I'm not particularly excited to be an insurance agent in the near future, I can at least appreciate being given the opportunity by someone who recognizes that my experience in working is semi-limited at this point but can stand to see great improvements over time. I'm going to fully commit to this position because it seems I don't have much else I can rely on as far as steady income right now. With any luck, maybe I'll come to see that working an office job of this nature isn't as draining as it seems, but I won't come in with any expectations of grandeur or a pleasant time.</p>
        <p>My child's gender reveal is this Saturday! I'm wagering that I'm going to be having a girl, but of course that's not a detail I'm going to get myself caught up in. No matter what the gender, I just hope that the weather abides by our planning and that everything goes smoothly. I know my girlfriend wants more than anything to be able to look back fondly on her pregnancy as opposed to reflecting on it poorly as a section of her life tainted by her mother's opinions on our choices. I want to at least make sure my girlfriend has a blast and it'll be a sight to watch the extended side of my family interact with hers for the first time. All in all, I think Saturday is going to be a good time for everyone involved and I'm going to be happy to know the gender regarless of what the outcome is. I'm also ready to start doing some work on our gift registry for the yet unnanounced baby shower(s)!</p>
        <p>Aside from those major things I wanted to get off my chest and onto text, I'm not entirely sure how I'm feeling for the most part. I feel apprehensive about this new job opportunity because I get the unfortunate feeling that it might be the kind of job my personal character isn't exactly cut out for, but I'm not going to let that stop me. I also feel a little guilty in letting my fluctuating dedication to coding and practicing these basic concepts. I feel more and more like I have an obligation to stay at my girlfriend's house for longer periods of time, on top of the already mounting time obligations as far as the holiday season, planning and acquiring for baby related things, caring for my siblings, etc. I know that if I begin working soon, that too will eat into not only the time but the mental acuity required for me to really sit down and sponge up these Odin Project lessons. Still, I know I am doing what I feel mentally capable of while I still have the time to do it.</p>
        <p>I'll probably give another update after the gender reveal, or later than that; contingent on whether some other notable life updates occur in the near future. 'Til then.</p>
