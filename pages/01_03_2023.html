        <h3>The New Year</h3>
        <p>First entry to ring in the new year. Hopefully we can make this year a lot more productive than the last.</p>
        <p>Realistically, nothing has changed in the last few days and it makes sense that nothing should. The changing of the year is more of a symbolic proposition if we really think about the concept of time anyways. I won't get into the semantics or a philosophical discussion about time as a concept. The year has changed, and although for the most part, my life remains in the same position as before, there are still things to look upon happily and things I will instill symbolic value to in my own life.</p>
        <p>I'm not technically employed yet, but it seems that any day now, the manager of the State Farm I applied to will be propositioning me with a formal job offer to work at his agency. With all due respect, the prospect of being an insurance broker does not seem all that exciting and promising for someone with my tastes (read: weird), but the irrevocable truth is that a job is a job. This is better than a minimum wage retail or fast food job, and probably will present at least markedly more opportunities for growth as far as a career in insurance can go. Though I'm not particularly excited to be an insurance agent in the near future, I can at least appreciate being given the opportunity by someone who recognizes that my experience in working is semi-limited at this point but can stand to see great improvements over time. I'm going to fully commit to this position because it seems I don't have much else I can rely on as far as steady income right now. With any luck, maybe I'll come to see that working an office job of this nature isn't as draining as it seems, but I won't come in with any expectations of grandeur or a pleasant time.</p>
