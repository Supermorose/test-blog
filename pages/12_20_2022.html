       <h3>Inevitability</h3>
       <p>It's been almost two weeks since my last entry. I didn't forget about this little online journal by any means, I've just found myself preoccupied with things in my real life that consume the time I originally planned to use to write a post. It feels like my last entry was really only a few days ago but I know that's not the case. Even feeling that two weeks ago feels like it was just recently, it also feels like the days are shuffling by and the inevitability of time is unflinching; staring me down.</p>
       <p>I haven't directly heard back from Enterprise, but I did give them a call this morning to ask about an update regarding the status of my application. The second interviewer told me that they were going to have a discussion with their area manager today and possibly get back to me, but I'm still dubious about the genuineness of that statement. Still, I have an in-person interview at a State Farm location near my house this week. It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if I got hired there somehow. In addition to that, I've reached out to a few of my favorite teachers from high school in regards to seeking employment at a charter school district. My AP Literature teacher Keith works at the same school, so he recommended that I have a chat with Lorena who used to be my English teacher but is now the assistant principal of the school. I also got in contact with my STEM teacher Jennifer. She works at another charter district now beacuse of some changes in her life, and she told me to weigh the benefits and negatives of both the charter schools as their internship and credential programs have different modes of operation. I still need to follow up on that but it might be an option that could pan out for me as well.</p>
       <p>Christmas is coming up. I only bought a present for my girlfriend, and I'll probably get something for my dad and my best friend but it seems like my budget is far more constrained these days. I wish that weren't the case; the people in my life deserve some kind of tangible affirmation that they are in fact important to me. Struggling to make things work without a steady income is difficult, but everyone knows that. </p>
       <p>I don't think that my interest in coding is waning per se, but I think the issue is that I get caught up in the real life things I need to attend to, and sometimes I feel like I really just want a break from human interaction and having to drive around and do things that involve other people. I know that in the near future I'll have to really cut the need for rest cold turkey, but still it's hard not to just sit down and watch a movie or lay back and relax for a little when I have the free time instead of plopping down at my desk and forcing my brain to morph itself into some kind of sponge for coding knowledge. Just learning about flexbox over the last week has kind of left my brain sore because I had to read and reread the lessons on flexbox to gain a rudimentary understanding of the subject. I understand the purpose that flexbox serves in CSS, and how it can assist a web developer in creating unique and interesting yet smooth website layouts, but I think that putting the concepts of flexbox (grow, shrink, basis) is a leap from simply knowing the terminology and what it's suppoed to do (in theory.)</p>
       <p>This entry feels a little longer but maybe it's good that I've taken my time before writing another entry; it lets me really release some of the thoughts in my mind even if they're non-sequiturs. The Prayer for Cleansing/Undying benefit show was this last weekend and I'm really getting FOMO because I couldn't be in attendance. I bought my tickets long before I ever found out that my girlfriend was pregnant, so that really just threw my plans off which is fine. I sold my ticket to this dude named Jack that I know. I hope he had a fun time just as much as my other friends who were able to go. Maybe if I'm lucky enough in this lifetime and no longer in a place of financial instability, I will get the opportunity to see them again, though I think the prospect of that is highly unlikely. On that note I probably need to go ahead and sell my tickets to see Pierce the Veil on New Year's Eve. That's really a bummer too, but there's just certain concessions that my girlfriend and I will have to make in the following years because raising a child constitutes a lot of changes we might not be all that happy with just yet.</p>
       <p>I think I'm gonna wrap things up here. I hope anyone who's reading this has a very enjoyable Christmas this year, and if you happen to be reading this outside of 2022, I hope that you have a great Christmas regardless of the year and what holiday you celebrate. See you guys later.</p>
