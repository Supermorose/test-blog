        <h3>Girl</h3>
        <p>The gender reveal went well, but in all honesty I think it could have been better in some ways too. Beggars can't be choosers but I refuse to subscribe to the idea that I asked too much of certain family members by requesting that they at least show up in a timely manner. The event had a slow start in the sense that people tricked in slowly, and unfortunately the timeline we were operating under was delayed because doing the gender reveal when a good amount of our invited guests still hadn't shown up seems, anticlimactic to say the least. That aside though, my girlfriend and I did have both friends and family there, and it was a good time for everyone involved. I'm happy that we had the chance to share that experience with those near and dear to us, and that they were all receptive to the idea of showing up for  what some might consider a 'white persons' style of event. As it turns out (and I'd somewhat secretly hoped for...) my girlfriend and I will be having a daughter! I don't really know if it's true that raising a daughter is somewhat easier than raising a son, but regardless of any of that I am elated and willing to do the work to support my family in any way I can.</p>
        <p>I believe I wrote about it in my last entry, but I have a meeting at State Farm tomorrow with the agent running the location and we will be discussing compensation options for when I begin working. I do hope that the pay is actually somewhat decent enough to cover at least a minimally nice means of living in California but having a nice life in California is an expensive venture. Depending on what the pay is I might still continue to epxlore other avenues in the near future, maybe something a little more lucrative can fall into my lap.</p>
        <p>I've really been struggling with the Landing Page Project portion of The Odin Project. I've done a lot of learning about flexbox, I've watched a good amount of YouTube videos regarding the subject and read and reread MDN lessons on it and yet I just can't crack whatever it is that isn't clicking inside of my head. I can sort of conceptualize the basic layout for how to accomplish the project, but when it comes time to actually write out the code for it, I seem to be making some kind of pivotal error or I cannot figure out the correct HTMl elements required to make my landing page appear the way it should. I don't want to move past that section without really understanding it, even if it's not certain to me that I'll end up in front-end web development. I just feel like I'm at a standstill where I really need to continue putting my head to the grindstone if I don't want to face failure in this endeavor. It's just difficult to find the motivation right now, because watching videos and reading articles and instructionals on the same subjects over and over hasn't helped me this far, and I don't know what else I can do besides just go back and refresh myself on old lessons in hope that maybe they can provide some kind of enlightenment on what I'm doing incorrectly. Just feels a little disheartening to think that maybe I don't understand the material as well as I thought I did.</p>
        <p>In other not-nearly-as-important news...</p>
        <p>I'm trying to line up a little trip for my girlfriend and my family. My girlfriend mentioned wanting to go up to the mountains while she was on Winter Break and not working, which unfortunately didn't pan out. Still I think there is a decent possibility that I can get my family to tag along and take a day or two in the weekend to go see the snow and just have a nice time altogether. I hope I can make it work because I think it's something my girlfriend would really appreciate.</p>
